# DHT-11-Modified-Driver-Class

Compile t.cpp: g++ -o t t.cpp lcd_horn.cpp -lwiringPi

Slight modifications to: https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-the-raspberry-pi/

t.cpp is a test file. Do yourself a favor and ignore it since it probably won't work for you.

*This was a very quick edit... it also never ended up as a single function rather than a class...
